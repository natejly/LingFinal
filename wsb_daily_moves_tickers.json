RSI’s only at 43 so it’s got gas left, MACD just flipped greener than a stimmy cheque, and it’s sitting right under the EMA21 at $1.74 like a coiled spring waiting to ruin some short seller’s weekend. Break that level and we’re moonwalking straight to $2.10, maybe even $2.80 if the volume keeps raging. Yeah, it’s a penny stock with commitment issues, but when volume hits a billion and apes start sniffing around, logic leaves the building.
