I do more investing than trading, which means longer term holds and keeps me out of big multi-baggers, but also consistently beating indexes.  \n\nMost here will recall how much I was pounding the table on UBER and LYFT at this time last year, calling for ~80-100% gains which has been achieved.  \n\nStill trying to formulate what the priority will be for 2026, but NFLX is shaping up as a good candidate.\n\nNetflix has won streaming, and is now poised to cruise on that dominance and cash flow.\n\nOne criteria of the priority pick is finding something underpriced.  Although it may still go down, Netflix could meet that.\n\nTwo months ago, NFLX’s ER revealed breathtaking strength in the business, a fact that was obscured by an one-off oddball tax charge in Brazil which they chose to absorb all at once and at that time.  \n\nAnd that business strength is obvious.  They are dominating.  The power of their advertising business is just beginning.  They’ve roped in the TV wrestling crowd who are price insensitive addicts.\n\nThey’ve opened a crack in the sports sponsorship boondoggle by using the much more profitable “sports entertainment event” tactic.  \n\nOn quantitative and qualitative measure, Netflix could have and perhaps should have vaulted to $150 on that ER.  Instead, it has plummeted straight down 30%.\n\nThe WBD thing is a mess, certainly, but what Wall Street and pundits don’t yet understand is that the end result of this saga is Win or Win for NFLX.  They prevail and sew up a monopoly?  Long term win.  Yes, some rough times as the numbers get skewed paying for it, but once those are washed through some shaky quarters, the effects of being a bigger monopoly will pay off later.\n\nAnd if they lose the bidding war? That’s also a win.  They’ll still be the 800 lb gorilla, the stock won’t have to be stalled while digesting the $80 billion or whatever the final cost is, plus they’ll have saddled their competitor with debt that their competitor’s operation is less equipped to handle.  And they’ll pocket a nice little competitor-funded bonus in the reverse breakup fee.  \n\nNFLX is shaping up like one of my other 2025 accumulations, GOOGL.  It presented the same arguments: a win-win regardless of the anti-trust ruling, and being underpriced.\n\nI already started accumulating close to $100 so today’s $95 was a gift and one I’ll keep buying as it drops.

Cost of non-fossil fuel power gen has crashed, enabled by Chinese economies of scale and innovation. Outside the US, there is no delusional regulatory capture by fossil fuels that prevent renewables buildout, so the economics of power gen matters. The economics is that renewables are extremely competitive.\n2. Even in US, US new power capacity is not even building out natural gas power plants much, and solar leads, so even at the ultra cheap US gas, power gen is not competitive. What do you think for an emerging market, will they pay a higher premium US LNG instead of just building renewables? Note that EM/poor countries have no natural gas infrastructure, so they need to invest in not only pipelines, power plants, but also LNG regassification, etc. that all reduce competitiveness of LNG.\n3. US LNG requires global LNG prices to be higher than domestic gas, at least \\~$1.5 per mmbtu higher than Henry Hub. This spread WAS very high, so LNG producers were making tons of money. This spread is getting narrower, so LNG margins have peaked.\n4. Geopolitics like China tariffs don't help. China was buying a lot of US LNG. Now that market is basically dead and not growing. This is because geopolitical stress reduce desire for US LNG. So China is now developing local natural gas production. Others like Japan are opening back up nuclear. Europe energy demand isn't increasing. Russian LNG has not left the market, only switched to China and India.\n5. US LNG is not the only source of LNG, although it is a cheap source. Qatar LNG, Canada LNG, Aus LNG, are all increasing supply. This reduces US LNG margins and overall margins for the entire sector. Qatar, Can, have not finished building out LNG yet, so more supply coming.",

So are healthcare and utility companies.\n\n&gt;Defensive stocks offer lower share-price volatility than other stocks but because they are non-cyclical their share prices often lag those of growth stocks during strong bull markets.\n\nSomething like PYPL I'd assume would probably still do bad in the case of a regression, even with a good valuation. Just because the nature of the stock. If less people are working, less people are spending, which means less people are likely to use PYPL. On top of that, it's already a crowded space to begin with. \n\nOutside of PYPL, there is already like cash app, venmo, apple pay, android pay and that's just naming off the top of my head. \n\nEveryone has different views and approaches in terms of valuating a company and determining if it's undervalued, fairly valued or overvalued. \n\nYou can use something like PE, but that can be even tricky. Different sectors have different PE ranges. A bank will normally have a lower PE than a software company. Same thing with like Price to Book or P/B. \n\nEven with PE's, there are things like value traps, which look overvalued, but the market doesn't want to give the assets a high PE for varies reasons, like slowing growth. \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuetrap.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuetrap.asp)\n\n&gt;A value trap is an investment that appears undervalued but lacks potential for growth.\n\n&gt;Value traps often feature low valuation metrics for extended periods.\n\n&gt;Investors should determine if low stock prices are due to temporary or permanent issues.\n\n&gt;Value investors are susceptible to value traps due to their focus on fundamental analysis.\n\nI personally like using PEG to try to determine value, since it takes into PE and EPS growth and is kind of agnostic to the sector/industry. I also like to keep it simple in terms of how I invest, so PEG helps out with that. \n\nI look at other things besides PEG to determine if I want to buy a stock. Like I look at quick ratio, ROIC, eps growth and revenue growth as some key factors. As long as the story makes sense, I don't fret about the price too much. \n\nThat's the thing about investing that is rough/sucks. You can find something that looks awesome, but the market isn't really interested and you can still lose money on the asset.",

Solar output in the first three quarters of 2025 has already surpassed total output in all of 2024. Combined with moderate growth in wind generation of 137 TWh (+7.6%), total solar and wind growth (+635 TWh) exceeded the increase in demand of 603 TWh (+2.7%).

In the first three quarters of 2025, declines in fossil generation in China (-52 TWh, -1.1%) and India (-34 TWh, -3.3%) tipped the balance of the global trend in fossil generation, and even balanced out fossil increases in the EU and US.",

I know nothing about Palantir except that they are pure evil.\n\nPalantir considers itself an AI company because it has built a comprehensive platform specifically designed to integrate AI into real-world operations. Here's how they fit into the AI space:\n\n**Their Main AI Product: AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform)**\n\nLaunched in April 2023, AIP integrates large language models and other AI technologies into organizations' existing operations. Think of it as the infrastructure that lets companies actually use AI in their day-to-day work, not just experiment with it.\n\n**What Makes Them Different:**\n\nRather than just building AI models, Palantir AIP connects generative AI to operations. They focus on taking AI from the lab into production environments where it can make real decisions. AIP allows users to create large language models with their own data in a secure environment, which is crucial for government agencies and corporations handling sensitive information.\n\n**How They Use AI:**\n\n* Their builder tools like AIP Logic, AIP Agent Studio, and AIP Evals enable the development of production-ready AI-powered workflows, agents, and functions \n* AIP enables controlled deployment of models like GPT-4o on classified systems, offering auditability, data masking and chain-of-thought reasoning \n* They integrate AI into their existing platforms (Gotham for defense/intelligence and Foundry for commercial use)\n\nSo while Palantir didn't start as purely an AI company—they began as a data analytics platform—they've pivoted heavily into AI by building the infrastructure that lets organizations safely deploy and operationalize AI in high-stakes environments like military operations, healthcare, and financial services.",

Operations are clean and straight forward, which means they can continue effectively as they are, or benefit from modernization.  Either way is a win.\n\nBeing in coffee and smoothies and energy drinks and snacks is good diversification.  \n\nOver and over, BROS stock has been hit by erroneous association with things like CAVA and SBUX and the restaurant implosion and overblown worries about coffee commodity.  \n\nI was here begging people to buy it a week or two ago at $43.

There's many reasons for this, some of which have no hard data in part because there is sparse data collected regarding automation.\n\n&gt;\"I spent two hours sweeping yesterday, and I have a mechanical engineering degree,\" said 24-year-old Ben Gooch of Dundas, Ont.\n\n&gt;The McMaster graduate is working part-time at a garden centre to cover some of his living expenses, having applied for upward of 100 jobs since December with only a handful of interviews to show for it. \"I feel like I'm just throwing darts out at a wall and hoping to get lucky and hit something.\" \n\n&gt;But Canadian research has shown that being unemployed at a young age during a recession can lead to a [persistent but non-permanent earnings loss](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5138018_The_Short-_and_Long-Term_Career_Effects_of_Graduating_in_a_Recession_Hysteresis_and_Heterogeneity_in_the_Market_for_College_Graduates) for many years after — a well-studied phenomenon known as \"[wage scarring](https://www.td.com/document/PDF/economics/special/ms0113_YouthUnemp.pdf).\" Other research also suggests that entering the labour market during a recession can impact a person's [health outcomes](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26638/w26638.pdf). \n\n&gt;\"Where it can lead to scarring — I mean, we might think of it as sort of a temporary blemish — but it can have long term implications when the economy goes into a serious recession,\" said Miles Corak, an Ottawa-based economics professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Centre.\n\n&gt;\"Long-term earnings prospects are dampened for people graduating during the recession — not because they're not getting jobs, but eventually they fall into a part of the labour market that isn't as high-paying, in types of occupations that they didn't anticipate doing,\" said Corak.\n\n&gt;The economic downturns seen in Canada during the early 1980s and 1990s show the impact of that scarring.\n\n&gt;Youth unemployment reached [a peak of 19.2 per cent](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-630-x/11-630-x2017004-eng.htm) in 1983, and rose again to 17.2 per cent in 1992 and 1993, with [real wage declines](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11847-eng.pdf?st=tIUTaX2s) observed among the 17 to 24 cohort in the years afterward.\n\nWage scarring, particularly in terms of earnings loss, implies to me that the current generation entering the work force is going to see fewer savings to invest in their retirements or the property markets. Not to mention all the additional negatives that come along with lacking money and starting later.\n\n[This ](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/youth-unemployment-rate-1.7549979)article from the CBC goes into it a bit more.",

Without billions of dollars in support from the UAE the RSF would've lost the war already.\n\nAnd seriously, look up labor abuses in the UAE where 90% of the workforce aren't locals, where these foreign workers have little to no rights at all, and have their passports confiscated after being lured to the country on false pretenses of highly paid work.",

They’re currently opening 10-15 new stores *PER MONTH*, and it snowballs faster every quarter.

They just had double beats and raise guidance again, a recurring pattern for their quarterly earnings.  \n\nThey sell stores to independent operators and open their own.  That’s a good thing, as their corporate owned stores are seeing SSS of 7.4%.\n\nThe stock has been unfairly pummeled.  First by people associating it with restaurants, which are struggling, not growing the way BROS has.  It’s also been associated with the floundering Starbucks which is wrong.  \n\nIf you’ve followed these sectors, the biggest gains are when something goes from regional to national.   BROS thinks they’re headed to 7000 stores, so that’s a 7x from here.\n\nThe homespun style gives them organic customer loyalty, unlike having to fake it like some corporate manual says.

Just google it instead of guessing there’s like 100 articles that all cite this as the reason it’s going down\n\n&gt;but a big part of their crash from $285 to $170 happened before such spending was even announced.\n\nWhat? first of all it never got below $193, so I don't know where you pulled $170 out from. Second of all, it was at $240 yesterday meaning it was only down \\~14% from ATH before today, so todays drop alone was a larger drop than the entire drop of the stock price from ATH before today.

If you had taken your profit close to the top, and then buy in close to the bottom, then you made a profit on the original sell PLUS the profit on the new correction, but if you buy and hold you are back to break even.... again, its impossible to time it, but you can get close +/- 2-4%. \n\nI am not holding onto cash, I put the money to work in short term treasuries or municipals while I wait for a good entry point. \n\nThe majority of my portfolio is in fairly safe assets like bonds and fixed income.

Which is what I did today. \n\nI typically swing trade safer equities anyways. Things that pay a dividend just in case if I have to bag hold it for a while... at least I make a dividend.

These results demonstrate the tangible impact of our strategic focus to drive growth in our ODR business, minimize risk, and improve the consistency of our revenue and earnings.\n\n“Limbach is delivering against all three core elements of our growth strategy, leveraging disciplined M&amp;A to accelerate scale and reinforce long-term growth. In the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Pioneer Power, expanding our footprint into the Upper Midwest, and deepening our access to industrial markets including power generation. Pioneer Power’s revenue performance exceeded our initial expectations this quarter. While Pioneer Power’s current margin profile differs from Limbach’s, we are actively integrating Pioneer into the Limbach platform and have a path to implement operational and commercial enhancements that we expect will expand its margins over time. Combined with our focus on expanding our top-line through our ODR business, broadening our service offerings, and deepening customer relationships, we are building a resilient business designed to deliver durable long-term value for our stockholders.”",

There’s a huge financial incentive for AI companies to at least try and diversify from the big lad, and openAI have already made a large move in that direction (Apparently 6GW which is somewhere between $50-100bn of chips over 5 years). I’m really struggling to see an outcome where AMD doesn’t at least approach 1/5th of the size of nvidia. (Which would be above 100% gain in share price). Even in this scenario that’s an insane monopoly for any company to maintain that you very rarely see in other industries.",

I'm not saying one should buy Tesla now, I own a small position and did well, but don't underestimate this company. Besides EVs, Tesla is actually one of the only US power providers able to take over the future of energy, in the form of utility scale batteries.\n\nNuclear has hype, yet it is likely not the energy of the future with how long and how much red tape there is. Natural Gas is cheap, but not the power turbines nor the pipeline infrastructure constraints. Hydro is limited. Wind is not really desirable because of power gen volatility. That leaves solar being the best alternative, and it is the best alternative, as EIA data shows more than half of new power gen in 2025 comes from solar.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Tesla? Natural gas was thought to be the bridge power to renewables and a steady generator when wind doesn't blow or sun doesn't shine. This thesis has actually been turned on its head due to new technology in batteries. [The second highest new power gen in the US in 2025, is actually new utility scale batteries](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65964), led by ERCOT in Texas, and using Tesla's products. Tesla sources batteries from China, most importantly CATL, whose stock has also gained massively and is highly correlated with TSLA stock.\n\nI'm not making the case for Tesla being over or undervalued, just that to underestimate the power of future technology that is being already realized now, simply due to random P/E ratios, is not a good idea. If Tesla has a US monopoly on EVs, battery power gen of the future, and other more speculative investments like robotics, then it is well worth the price.",

      "text": "So it works if everyone else grows too.  You can agree that the market is supposed to grow by 10-11% per year in a historically average year right?  Well just basic math would say that means the Dow will be at 100,000 within a predictable number of years.  That the S&amp;P will be 14,000+ before we know it.  And several big companies like MSFT, APPL and whomever will grow along with it, possibly being 5+T companies themselves.  It's even likely because they're both at 3.9T and on the verge of being 4T each.  Several other big players will be coming up along with them, ones that aren't always obvious at this point.\n\nIn fact APPL is now 3.99T and MSFT is 3.95T, so them going well past 4T is a certainty.  Companies being 8T+ is not a stretch, it's a matter of time.\n\nI think that's the only real disagreement we can have is timeline.  The bearish view says this is a bubble and it's about to pop.  Assuming for a moment that is true, that would at most be a temporary setback.  Bears like to point out the dotcom bubble, well ok if we're going to revel in that historical precedent then it must also be accepted that the dotcom bubble was only a bubble on timing.  Things got inflated hot a little too soon, before the tech was fully baked and ready for broad adoption.  It was a miss by a couple of years.  So it's not like the internet was a failure or .com's are stupid, it's that they were just a hair early and the market got overexcited for it.\n\nBut if you stayed invested broadly, if you waited out that bubble, you had massive gains on the other side.  So even in the bear case, this is at worst, just a bit early.  It's not wrong, and it's not an incorrect prediction of how software is going to change.  It just might be that things land in 2035 instead of 2030.\n\nEither way, the correct course of action is stay invested.  If you're cherry picking winners and losers, then good luck on that front.  That's not something I would want to try and do.",

We remain focused on driving above market growth.\"\n\n&gt;Mr. Olosky continued, \"As we look ahead, we are undertaking proactive strategic cost savings initiatives to align our operations with evolving market demand and position the Company for long-term success. We expect these initiatives to generate at least $30 million in annualized cost savings. While these decisions are never easy, we remain committed to supporting our people and maintaining our strong focus on innovation, customer service, and operational excellence. Our proven ability to outperform the market, maintain strong margins, and consistently grow EPS ahead of net sales, gives us confidence in delivering sustained shareholder value, even in a challenging environment.\"",

There's a lot of the hottest stuff that I'd be more interested in down another 20-30%.  ASTS is down 25% lately and still up 229% YTD. OKLO is down about a third lately, but still up 450% YTD and worth $17.7B despite not having a commercial operation going until 2027. \n\nMaybe it turns around and continues higher and that would be great for the remainder of my holdings (and I do like the long-term story of ASTS; in terms of drone theme names like RCAT I own a handful of foreign names like Droneshield) but imo at some point the risk/reward near-term for some of the hottest names becomes less appealing (and I'm definitely not buying things with like an 80-90 RSI in the midst of a FOMO pile-on.)\n\nThere's been two times in the last 5 years (2022, early 2025) where people had significant gains in growth stocks only to give a lot of them back. That's not saying bearish, that's not saying imminent market cratering, not saying market can't go higher - it's just saying at some point the chase in some of this stuff up 300% YTD as if there is no reasonable ceiling can quickly turn and the last people to the investment party are often the first ones out when all the sudden some of this stuff is down 20-25% in a week or two.

For example, CROX had a bunch of one time losses last year, and as a result they did not earn a ton. Their current P/E is 22x backwards looking earnings. However, those were one time charges, so they won't pay them next year. So their forward P/E is 7x. This does depend on estimates of future earnings, so be wary.\n\nLong answer to say, P/E isn't worthless, but you need to look at it as part of a whole, larger story.",

Government is shut down and pretty soon millions will be without a pay check. Trade tensions are ratcheting back up with China. Mexico’s tariff pause expires in a few weeks and there’s no deal. On the AI front, big picture, we’re now three years from the launch of ChatGPT and AI still can’t make any money. Perhaps worse, there’s a cavernous gap between capex and projected revenue from end use cases. It doesn’t seem like that ever gets filled. The circular financing happening right now is reminiscent of past bubble behavior.\n\nThere’s more but all this makes me think maybe stocks should not be at the highest valuations in US history? Maybe they shouldn’t go up every day? Maybe we shouldn’t have by far the most concentrated market in history? Maybe we should be pricing some risk that things don’t pan out according to the most optimistic scenarios, maybe stocks aren’t really risk free assets. \n\nBut then on the flip side, there’s really compelling bullish arguments as well. For example, an analist yesterday said he thinks NVDA is worth 7 trillion. In explaining why, he made a really persuasive point. He said of NVDA, “baby it was born to run”. I don’t think a reasonable person can argue with that.\n\nSo yeah, really well reasoned, persuasive arguments on both sides. I’ll need to think on this over the weekend. But in the meantime, while I figure out whether I believe stocks are obscenely over valued or we should just sing Bruce Springsteen and smash the buy button, the only reasonable thing to do is max out the margin debt, maybe the HELOC as well and yolo it all on quantum and space junk.",

Web traffic began to build late in the quarter and has continued into the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025 (Q4 2025), supporting stronger e-commerce activity.\n\nGross profit for Q3 2025 increased to $16.9 million (60% of net revenue) from $13.0 million (62% of net revenue) in Q3 2024, reflecting the strong increase in sales. Gross margin performance reflects the changing channel mix, which saw much stronger dealer sales, as well as one-time startup costs associated with the Compact Launcher launch and associated manufacturing ramp-up costs. Since its launch in Q2 2025, the Compact Launcher (CL) has achieved faster production yield improvements compared to previous product releases. Byrna anticipates that CL margins will continue to grow as production volume increases and manufacturing processes become more efficient.\n\nOperating expenses for Q3 2025 were $14.1 million, compared to $12.2 million for Q3 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher variable selling expenses, and increased discretionary marketing spend to support growth.\n\nNet income for Q3 2025 was $2.2 million, an increase from $1.0 million for Q3 2024, driven by an overall increase in product sales and operating leverage.",

Be flexible, have a large investable universe. Maybe parts of the market are in a bubble but others are not. This is a market where there are absolutely a fair amount of things that haven't done well and there are sections of the market where I could close my eyes and point to a random name and probably do well.

In the last 5 years there's been these sort of \"best of times/worst of times\" markets where certain things go up every day while other things have a lousy time. In the ultra-short term, we're pretty much at all time highs/there are parts of the market that go up every day but if I searched for technically oversold (RSI below 30) there's nearly 400 names with a lot of noteworthy ones. \n\nSome of those names are microcaps, some of them are companies facing significant issues but out of that list, I'd think most people could find a name or two worthwhile. \n\nThere's always opportunities out there. Sometimes they're more difficult to find, sometimes it's difficult to move away from focusing entirely on what's hot to take at least a little advantage of what's not.",

This looks like a vendor financing arrangement. AMD has given OpenAI free stock, which they are free to sell. OpenAI will probably do that and there is where they’ll get the money to buy AMD’s chips. AMD gets to book revs and profit and the bet is that the stock soars. More tranches of warrants vest, repeat. \n\nThis is looking like the same type of vendor financing arrangement as NVDA, except instead of funding it with cash that AMD does not have, Lisa has decided to fund it with shareholder dilution. Essentially she’s said, look Sammy boy, I don’t have 100 billion, but what I do have is stock, which you can sell for a hundred billion. Here you go, now feel free to sell it so you have money to buy my chips. Oh and who pays for that? Well if you’re and AMD shareholder, you do.\n\nSo, to recap, Jensen uses a boatload of cash that ought to belong to shareholders to finance OpenAI purchasing his own chips. Lisa sees this and thinks, I don’t have that kind of cash, but I can dilute shareholders for similar money. And she goes ahead and does that.\n\nSo there you go folks, these two visionary titans of industry are basically just using your money to buy their own chips.\n\nAnalysts had this to say: “In the long run, the ones who will truly be paying for OpenAI’s giant purchase of AMD GPUs will be retail and institutional investors if they bid up the stock price.” Reminder that you’ve already done that.\n\nP.S. How about a little irony? The final tranche of OpenAI’s warrants vest at a share price of $600. And what is AMD’s market cap at that price? About a trillion. So let’s see OpenAI will own 10%…. Carry the two….. oh yes, it’s 100 billion that Lisa potentially gave OpenAI, matching Jensen. Except unlike Jensen, she has to give up a stake in her company for it, while Jensen gets a stake in OpenAI for the same money. You can’t make this shit up.",

Hence I've been consolidating my portfolio into 15-30 core positions I have the highest conviction on and the remaining funds are being put into QQQ/VOO/AVUV/AVDV. With my daughter growing up and more stuff to do, I just don't have the same time to enjoy researching companies and maintaining a 100% active portfolio.",

Good time to enter?\n\nI spent 3 minutes writing the below so I'm gonna comment it even though you deleted your comment lol\n\nI've owned for close to 8 years with adds all along the way. Looking at a reverse DCF with TTM data and inputting 25% FCF margin, you'd need \\~22% annual revenue growth over the next decade to justify today's price. They've grown revenue 36% over the LTM, 38% in FY24.\n\nFor FCF margin, they actually hit 31% in 2023 and 34% in 2024. So change the reverse DCF input from 25% to 30% and you need 19.5% annual revenue growth over the next decade to justify today's price.\n\nIf you want to look at historical valuations, MELI is trading just below their 1Y and 3Y averages on P/S, P/GP, P/FCF, and EV/EBITDA.\n\n||Today|1Y|3Y|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**P/S**|4.7|5.3|5.3|\n|**P/GP**|9.1|10.0|9.8|\n|**P/FCF**|15.3|16.8|19.5|\n|**EV/EBITDA**|29.5|31.9|32.6|\n\n  \nWould I add here?

They're more likely in the 15% growth area, which is awesome, but we're seeing a re-rating to reflect that. There is a really good breakdown making the rounds on X with a valuation of CSU showing it's basically at fair value for 15% growth. \n\nPersonally, I'm interested in adding to TOI here. They're really hitting their stride on capital deployment and Europe is a fertile playground. \n\nAs far as Mark Leonard retiring....the whole function of the company is to deploy cash in a completely decentralized way.

Still like the company long term and if you don't mind paying a bit more of a premium since you are planning on holding long term, I think the company has a lot of great tailwinds and secular growth story. \n\nNot the best in the world with TA, but the RSI is now at 31, so it's technically just a tad bit above becoming oversold. Personally, I don't sweat some price differences too much, like I could probably snag some sub like 95, that would be great, but long term wise, you are probably paying a little bit of a premium on the company. \n\nAt least they are seeing growth come back, like the last two quarters of revenue growth was basically 12% and then 16.4%.  Margins are pretty stable around 28% and operating margins did improve again. EPS growth is still solid and good ROIC. \n\n[https://quickfs.net/company/LMB:US](https://quickfs.net/company/LMB:US)\n\nI'm always just a fan of CLMB, one my favorite companies I own. PEG really varies between finviz and stockanalysis,  my best guess is lack of analysts and just wonky financials. They made some acquisitions recently and their revenue growth exploded. Like last quarter was like 73% growth. RSI here is much higher, so could wait for a better entry, since it's a super low volume stock, it can really trade in weird ways. Like the volume today is around like 13K shares being traded. That's one of the things I love about the company, it's low volume and low float, so not really a trading thing.",

ACIC is a name out of Florida that is really highly regarded among insurance people. KINS is one out of NYC that has almost no following due to its size. I like KINS more because NYC has been exited by a number of large players and KINS is sucking up market share in the resulting vacuum.

Both are common myths though, and part of what is artificially crushing renewables stocks like ENPH.\n\nElectricity is everyone’s worst bill, and the cost is only rising parabolically.  Getting free electricity from the sky is just smart.  Subsidies to help offset needed generation was smart too, but not essential.  \n\nIf I said I have free gold bars for pickup, “but no subsidy to help pay for you to come claim them” I’m pretty sure people would still realize the benefit.  \n\nA moderate investment in solar on one’s building can bring steep and instant reductions in electric bills, ranging from 50-95%.  And that’s a bonus that gets bigger every day as evil megacorps are sucking up all the available electricity for their data center ambitions.  The cost to put the solar up isn’t “lost”, it adds to the building value.\n\nIn a lot of cases, the immediate savings and a loan for the solar install are a saw off.  And even when they’re not, the payback period is short, and it gets shorter with every electric utility rate hike.\n\nEven the so-called “high” borrowing rates don’t change this reality.  They only add a few years on the payback period.  And as rates come down, the benefits snowball for solar consumer.",

Our growth has been driven by operational excellence with our existing clients enabling us to win significant market share from our competition while our differentiated value proposition resulted in continued new logo wins with trophy clients throughout the year. Importantly, this quarter marked the shift from proof of concept for our AI solutions to full scale deployments, setting the table for future growth. Fiscal 2025 was a milestone year across many fronts, including our successful entry into India. Importantly, we accomplished all this while delivering record profits and EPS.\n\n&gt;Last year at this time I said we believed we’d reached an inflection point for ibex with a return to growth.

However, this first quarter is simply a timing issue. The underlying fundamentals of the business remain strong, and our overall outlook is extremely encouraging. As noted in our previous quarter’s results, we booked some revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 that we previously believed would not ship until fiscal year 2026. In addition to this pulled-forward revenue, this quarter’s results were also impacted by customer-driven delays on a few key programs. It is important to recognize that these are neither cancellations, nor contract reductions. In fact, we expect at least one of these programs to be expanded significantly, increasing the total contract value. Further, we expect this to be resolved in the near-term and for these programs to contribute positively to revenue and operating profit over the coming quarters, predominantly in this fiscal year. As we have mentioned numerous times, our growth is not perfectly linear, given the cadence of contract awards and customer-driven activity, and we remain highly confident in the overall upward trajectory.",

One of the models is a higher margin business where they do maintaince and work with companies to lower bills. \n\nThis is the business they are trying to get going forward vs the old line of business, which is more like bidding on one time contracts. \n\nLike looking at their numbers: \n\n[https://quickfs.net/company/LMB:US](https://quickfs.net/company/LMB:US)\n\nLike 2020, the gross margins where 14.3% vs last year 27.8% \n\nSame with the operating margins, going from like 3% to 8%. \n\nHowever, I still think as the market could be rotating/profit taking, it's one of those names that has seen insane growth in the terms of returns on the asset, so I can see this thing still getting hit. \n\nAt this rate.

It would help you if you thought IV were going to spike way up on TSLA but a lot of the premium on TSLA options is already made up of IV that's just how some stocks are. I don't think it's a very efficient use of capital and you need to look at an options calc for long-dated puts to see your range of percent profitability. You also need to think about if you buy at strikes far OTM, which will increase in value as the underlying goes down, but is there is anyone actually going to buy them or will they not fill. Like if you buy the Dec 27 10 put now for like $25. Nobody is going to give af about that put unless TSLA is going bankrupt because the stock may not go down close to that &lt; 1 delta strike by 2027. Anyways if you buy options you really need to be right and you need to be right quickly and then decide your % profit range beforehand and then take profit and stop looking at the prices.",

LLMs alone (a small portion of the future AI landscape) have delivered far more value than their hosts have been able to charge for/capture, likely 10x is a reasonable estimate, and LLM products are incredibly young and unsophisticated, meaning the value they create is likewise a juvenile glimpse of what's to come.\n\n\nGo ahead and stand in front of the train, but you will be flattened.\n\nAgain, revenues &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earnings in nascent industries.

Labor is a potential big issue due to the lack of immigration right now. I also think there will be more competition from existing homes coming to market. \n\nThere are a few niche players I'd consider for builders, IBP and CVCO among others, but they've both run pretty good lately and I don't think either is super cheap right now. I think I had CVCO targeted around $400 and IBP around $150.",

I don't even track it in my watchlist, because I don't think it's a top 40/50 company I would want to ever own. Fears might be overblown, but it's just not a place I can seriously put money into if I want to outperform. GOOG is one of the eight companies I hold because it has elite business quality.\n\nOn a risk reward basis looking for market beating returns at current valuations I can rattle off multiple companies in my watchlist that will outperform UNH over the long term. I own S&amp;P Global, ASML, FICO, Constellation Software, and Moody's, which are all superior companies with incredible businesses which will continue to outperform the market with reasonable valuations. Nintendo &amp; Hawkins, inc. are exceptional companies that have run a bit beyond my intrinsic value assumptions but I continue to hold due to their potential.\n\nOn my watchlist alone, I see companies like ServiceNow, MercadoLibre, Intuitive Surgical, MSCI, Ferrari, etc. that all have superior prospects to United Healthcare, but I feel I have superior companies I'm holding at valuations I deem acceptable.

More of this and would suggest a consumer that's definitely starting to slow spending. \n\nJACK -60% YTD, WEN -37%, CMG -28%, SHAK -17%, PTLO - 14% (-78% from IPO a few years ago),  DIN -30%, SG -70%, CAVA -26% (ytd before earnings), TXRH -2%, QSR -1%, LW (fries) -20% YTD, etc. \n\nPositive (at least for now): DRI +10% (unlimited breadsticks), YUM +6%, DPZ +1%, PZZA +6%, MCD +3%, EAT +12.5%, CBRL +9%, BROS +22% (although down about 20% from earlier this year.), CAKE +28%, WING +17%. \n\nFood from home: KR +17% YTD, SFM +11%.\n\nIMO, CAVA was a bubble at $140 (and locations valued at $56M or whatever it was at the peak), it probably gets overdone to the downside (especially in a difficult environment like this, moreso if it gets worse.) Any time a consumer growth story decelerates a little it's significant. I mean, WING has had two declines of 50%+ in the last 5 years.  SHAK IPO'd about a decade ago and has returned about 140%, but shareholders have had to sit through three 60%+ declines and three 30%+ declines. Could have done better with less stress just owning the index or even WMT over that time period.\n\nHope it does well. Probably is a decent long-term story but hard to know where the macro bottoms and with the volatility of restaurant/consumer growth stories (recent examples elsewhere, ELF, CELH, BRBR) over time just sometimes feels as if there's easier long-term stories.",

So their EPS is boosted by the fraud AND their  balance sheet is SIGNIFICANTLY more leveraged than it seems due to the overstatement of assets.\n\n**what will happen is once the recession and earnings crush hits, they will just suddenly depreciate the remainder of the life cycles as a \"one time loss\", have INSANELY negative EPS, and poof the fraud is gone.\n\nThis shit happened in 1999 with cisco equipment and all that as well.

Second, the future of third-party cookies — critical for tracking, targeting and optimizing programmatic campaigns — remains unresolved. **And then there’s Google, which is quietly rearranging the web with AI Overviews. If users get their answers directly from Google’s summaries rather than clicking through to actual pages, the digital real estate available for The Trade Desk to buy ads shrinks.** \n\nThere’s also the matter of Mediaocean. A few months ago, agencies took a financial stake in the company, giving them a direct incentive to push a rival. That’s likely one reason Kokai hasn’t caught on directly at the holdcos — The Trade Desk needs agency buy-in to thrive, but agencies now have skin in another game.\" (https://digiday.com/marketing/the-trade-desk-stumbles-and-the-ad-tech-world-cheers-maybe-too-soon/)\n\nStock is way oversold so you could certainly get a bounce, but looking beyond that, imo the story that I found so appealing several years ago has changed and has concerns that I don't see answers to. I mean, there is a case to be made that TTD is impacted by AI and perhaps that's happening quicker than people thought - this is a company who used to frequently beat and have the stock up 20-30% post earnings. Lately, it's a company that is down 30% post earnings.   Green also sold a shit ton of stock early this year at levels that are twice where the stock currently is.",

For items with an existing tariff above 15%, no additional tariff will be imposed.\n\n&gt;That promise was absent from an executive order signed by the president on July 31, which shows only the European Union enjoying this more favorable calculation. White House officials confirmed to Japanese media on Wednesday that the Japanese rate will be determined as published and not by using the EU method that caps some rates at 15%.\n\n&gt;Also under the terms of the July 22 handshake agreement, Trump’s tariffs on automobiles are to be cut in half from 25%, with the new total being 15% when a 2.5% levy independent of the Trump tariffs is included.\n\n&gt;The White House has yet to announce when it will lower the duties on automobiles from the current 25%, and this has led to considerable concern in Tokyo.",

Insiders owned 696,065 shares (2.3%) when 2024 ended. Some of the share decrease is due to board members retiring (one had owned nearly 93,000 shares but isn't an insider anymore) but included in those big share decreases is the CEO (who sold 45% of his shares, nearly 300,000 of them) and the EVP of Patient Access and Therapy Development (who sold 47% of his shares, nearly 47,000 shares).\n\n&gt;I had remained cautiously bullish on INSP as I believed the tech would continue to see strong demand and adoption even in the face of potentially decreasing cases of sleep apnea as obesity dropped from GLP-1s but this insider selling has given me second thoughts.\n\nLooks liked insiders knew what was coming. A recent 4.4% cut to FY guidance has driven the stock down 40% today. I stick think the tech is impressive and truly makes a difference but DermTech also had incredible tech that improved patient lives... and they went bankrupt because management couldn't execute.\n\nInspire may rebound a bit. They may get bought out at a slight premium. This may be the bottom. That's fine. I'm out. Sold for a 68% loss (SPY was +44% and QQQ was +58% over the time I held) and put my remaining money into VOO, QQQ, AVUV, and AVDV.

Maybe they can get there with scaling.\n\nOr maybe it's like saying, we've built a car that can drive from New York to LA, so clearly all we have to do is scale it up to make it to Mars. The problems can be quite different.\n\n**My general take on AI stuff is this: low-quality content has always been there.** Pulp paperbacks, B-moves (mockbusters even), low quality TV shows on cable networks. They have their place but haven't yet taken the place of high-quality, intentionally produced media. AI's big lie is that it's somehow going to take the place of _exceptional_ entertainment by generating stuff that is basically an _average_ of its inputs. At best it's going to replace the low-quality stuff, and our current low-quality entertainment is already cheap to produce, arguably cheaper than AI use is at the moment. \n\nGames are no different. Story, world building, and especially _level design_ are skilled art forms that differentiate good games from bad ones. There have always been bad games, even bad games that have AAA graphics but the level design just isn't there. And procedurally generated levels have existed since the beginning of games. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Often it feels hollow, so it's well suited to games that are run and gun with short rounds, but not for immersive environments and storytelling.\n\nSo I don't know. They're going to crank out nonsense an expect it to displace the best stuff? Are we going to generate bespoke games for individuals? If you defeat a level 78 dragon lord after collecting all the weapons and armour and doing all the side quests in a game _nobody has ever heard of_ because it was generated just for you, did it really happen?\n\nCouple all this with the fact that Moore's law is dead. [This image](https://blog.octo.com/good-news-moore's-law-is-dead-long-live-eroom!/image1.webp) illustrates nicely why I haven't felt the need to upgrade my PC in a decade. Progress has slowed, and now we are approaching hard limits on chip design with quantum tunneling that will interfere and cause errors if we go smaller. What you're used to, having what would be a supercomputer 30 years ago in your pocket now, may not be possible. Scaling up will be linearly expensive in both capex and power usage.\n\nChips _may_ get smaller but Moore's law was always meant to be an _economic_ law, not necessarily a physical one. It's just too expensive to go any smaller or more efficient. If the next gen CPUs cost 10x or 100x, who is going to buy them?",

In addition, ODR gross profit grew 24.6%, representing 79.3% of total gross profit. Our strategic focus on the ODR segment is yielding measurable value as we expand margins, reduce risk, and generate more predictable revenue and profits. This momentum continues to build, reinforcing our confidence in our growth strategy and Limbach’s position as a leading provider of essential building systems solutions for existing critical infrastructure.\n\n“We believe we are still in the early stages of fully realizing the value of our customer relationships and market reach. To build on this momentum, we’ve made strategic investments in our sales organization aimed at strengthening our go-to-market strategy — prioritizing enhancements to our national account approach and accelerating our ability to collaborate with customers on their capital programs. These efforts are aimed at deepening relationships, enhancing engagement, and positioning us as a trusted, long-term partner. This, combined with a robust M&amp;A pipeline and disciplined operational execution, positions Limbach well for continued growth and we remain focused on creating long-term value for our stockholders.”",

This strong growth underscores the strength of our product set and the efficacy of our balanced book of property and casualty and residential and commercial products. Our financial metrics were equally stout as we generated an adjusted combined ratio of 73%, and a 24% adjusted return on equity.”\n\nMr. Armstrong continued, “Beyond our financial performance, we remain focused on achieving our 2025 strategic imperatives. Notably, the successful execution of our June 1 reinsurance program at an adjusted rate decrease of approximately 10% year-over-year should help drive consistent earnings the remainder of 2025 and into 2026.  We continue to make investments across our organization, that enhance the talent and operational scale of our business and ultimately strengthen the near-term and long-term prospects of Palomar.”",

Our MedTech business grew 46% while our Advanced Components business declined 20%. Adjusted operating income and adjusted net income grew 35% and 27%, respectively. Gross margins were 28.8% despite being impacted by approximately $1.2 million in incremental labor costs at our AJR facility. This was due to recent turnover in the workforce related to our post-acquisition review of US employment eligibility through E-Verify protocols. We have successfully recruited legally eligible replacement associates and anticipate that Q3 will be the low point of labor inefficiencies, with gradual improvement beginning in the fourth quarter.”\n\n“We completed two acquisitions during our second quarter: Universal Plastics &amp; Engineering (UNIPEC) and Techno Plastics Industries (TPI),” said Bailly. These will expand our capabilities in tight-tolerance specialty film components and in thermoplastic molding for the medical device market. In addition, we continued to make progress with our expansion plans in Santiago and La Romana, Dominican Republic, to accommodate further anticipated growth in the safe patient handling and robotic-assisted surgery markets.”",

Irisity AB (stock ticker: IRIS.ST) is a Swedish tech firm listed on Nasdaq Stockholm First North Growth Market, specializing in AI-powered video analytics and surveillance solutions. Their IRIS+ platform secures over 3,000 sites globally, with subsidiaries like Agent Vi (Israel, book value 300–400 MSEK, market value 100–150 MSEK), Visionists (Sweden, 10–20 MSEK), and Ultinous (Hungary, 30–40 MSEK). That’s a total book value of 340–460 MSEK (2.10–2.88 SEK/share), yet the market cap sits at just 140–210 MSEK – the stock’s undervalued due to these gems!So why the slide? The price has been dropping for months, now at 0.25 SEK, hit by dilution (36.6% last year), a shaky cash position (5–6 MSEK post-21.1 Mkr emission in April), and delayed customer payments. But here’s the twist – behind the scenes, they’ve quietly launched a joint venture in Saudi Arabia (26–27 July) tied to Vision 2030! With 529k shares traded today, something’s brewing. The drop could be Stockhorn (24% owner) positioning for a bigger stake via a new emission, or savvy small investors snapping up cheap shares. Either way, this undervaluation screams opportunity – get in before the Q2 report (15 Aug) lifts it! UK/US investors, don’t sleep on this!\\*",
