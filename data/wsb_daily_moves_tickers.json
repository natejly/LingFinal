This also means that now hospitals, federally-funded non-profits, and state/ county/ city/ police/ teacher pension funds are allowed or required to include KMI in their portfolios.  Institutional investors have kept adding adding KMI and block selling once stock gets close to $30, but better believe it, once the massive buy-in finishes along with shares buy backs, retail will get float squeezed.

To me that seems like a huge deal when AMD is 10x smaller of a company. I think there must be more orders for MI450 in the pipeline if it is a competitive alternative to next gen Nvda line. To this point none of the AMD line has seen a deal anything like this magnitude. AMD stock was at 160 back in 2021 before AI was even a thing in the stock market. Well before NVDA meteoric rise. Now we have a confirmed revenue stream in AI that's bigger than the whole of 2021 revenue and AMD stock price is only 25% above that point... Seems crazy lol. I'm sure we have a ways to go here.",

Tactically, we think the market has already priced this in over the last 3 weeks, and we’d need to see upside vs. our new estimates to argue for more sustained near-term stock outperformance. However, we’re biased to argue just that — that our next earnings adjustment is likely higher again, because at 243M iPhone units in FY26 (+3% Y/Y), we are assuming replacement cycles still extend with the iPhone 17, which feels conservative vs. early demand commentary.\n\nMore importantly, the key driver of a stronger iPhone 17 cycle — an aged iPhone installed base in need of upgrades — combined with the first-ever Foldable iPhone and 6 total new iPhone launches next cycle (and sustained aggressive subsidies) supports high-single digit Y/Y iPhone revenue growth extending into FY27, even before we make any assumptions around AI. As a result of these factors, we are raising our FY26 and FY27 EPS by 2% and 6%, respectively, and increasing our price target to $298, or 32x our new FY27 EPS of $9.30, 6% above Consensus. Our new bull case valuation of $376 embeds a scenario where Apple ships around 270M iPhones and does over $10 of earnings power in FY27, which we see as achievable if Foldables and AI catalyze even stronger demand than we are contemplating in our base case, though we believe the market is likely to start pricing in these factors more materially in early 2026.\"",

Then get on the **ORIS** train because we are departing the station shortly.\n\n**Stock:**\n\n* ORIS - Oriental Rise Holdings Ltd.\n* Market cap: $3.6 million (As of 9/18/2025 intraday)\n\n**About**:\n\n* Oriental Rise Holdings Ltd. engages in the cultivation, processing, and sale of tea leaves and tea products. It operates through the Primarily-Processes Teas and Refined Teas segments. The company was founded by Chun Sun Wong, Wai Kwong Fong and Deming Zhou on January 25, 2019 and is headquartered in Ningde, China.\n* Stock IPO'd at \\~$5/share\n* Low float: 3.21 million shares\n* Short interest: 94%\n* [https://ir.mdhtea.cn/](https://ir.mdhtea.cn/)\n\n**Fundamentals**:\n\n* 94% short float out of the available 3.21M shares is ABSURD.\n* The stock should be valued on paper at least at a $70M market cap solely based on the equity in the company.\n* Current market cap is \\~$3M.\n* Nearly 0 debt. Profitable. Positive OCFs and FCFs.\n* Small company with 69 employees.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n* This stock could do a reverse stock split to comply with the NASDAQ requirements\n* The notice was issued on June 30, 2025, because the company's stock failed to maintain the minimum bid price requirement. Stocks must maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share.\n* Non-Compliance Period: If a stock's closing bid price is below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ issues a deficiency notice.\n* Compliance Period:\n   * Companies have 180 calendar days from the notice to regain compliance by achieving a closing bid price of $1.00 or higher for 10 consecutive business days.\n   * If the company fails to comply within the initial 180 days, it may be eligible for a second 180-day period, provided it meets other listing standards (e.g., market value or shareholders' equity) and notifies NASDAQ of its plan to cure the deficiency, often through a reverse stock split.\n* Reverse Stock Split: A reverse stock split (e.g., 1-for-10, reducing the number of shares and increasing the per-share price) is a common strategy to boost the bid price above $1.00. Companies must execute this within the compliance period to avoid delisting.\n* ORIS has until *December 29, 2025,* to regain compliance.\n\n**TLDR**:\n\n* ORIS does not deserve to be shorted to the ground by Wall St. The company just doesn’t have a “growth story” YoY and I think Wall St took advantage by shorting the fuck out of it. This stock should be valued at least 10x higher (mínimum). Again, although a small company, the fundamentals are SOLID for the size of the company. Be early, because this thing is going to fly.",

If people want some serious DD - I can post it. Basically - company doesn't make money, never has (even in 0 interest environment), and the business model has been tested before (and failed) - ie: zillow. You can literally see this here: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/OPEN/opendoor-technologies/operating-income](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/OPEN/opendoor-technologies/operating-income) . This company is (imo) a worse version of failed business models. Reality is tho - nobody cares, it's a meme (and I know that too). Memes be weird\n\n\\---\n\nRate cuts are not going to make this one profitable. Insiders selling sub $1 knew this. If they really believed in the underlying business (or were smart) wouldn't have been selling. Everyone knew these were probably coming. The guy pumping it to the moon is a meme, he's calling it open army, trying to get famous people to buy, and well... I can go on. He's basically moonshoting it because his fund is failing. Other well known people agree with me. IE: love him or hate him, pharma bro called it an obvious short (and did a 30min live DD on youtube WHERE HE INTERACTED WITH BULLS) and was doing serious DD (not a meme). See his twitter + youtube for the DD + details. Others are short too... I'll update positions / roll tomorrow pending price action..

I don't win them all (it's impossible) - but everyone was looking at the same thing.\n\nI suspect (based off sentimental analysis) - that if OPEN dropped into mid 5's, people would be thinking \"meme might be over / falling much harder\". Anything mid 5's would have \\*at least\\* legged down to 5. The payout of these puts was \\~2.5:1 if that occurred - which I considered when holding the puts / bet (anything greater than \\~35% odds was worth holding). I figured odds were higher, so I held. Payoff was actually positive. I chatted with \\~4 different people about OPEN (who all seemed smart) and had the same view \"yah, I know it's a meme but I'm long because it's a meme\"\n\n...My bet didn't work / payoff (I still hold the view it was a positive EV bet). Long term - I hold my macro / bearish views on this one, and if market hasn't this is a meme / going waaaay down yet, I can just roll / reconsider positions.

Other than that, the market hates uncertainty, but since April uncertainty is being removed (no full-blown trade war), and if something happens triggering a pullback, then people won't be caught off-guard as they are actively hedged. we'll only get a significant correction once people becomes more careless with hedging or something unexpectedly big happens",

Thats just one employee. The insurance company never tossed us and over 4 years we received a rate increase that never exceeded 3%. So, keep gobbling the leftist socialist goop.
