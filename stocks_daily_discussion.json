Looking ahead, we see demand for our products continuing to accelerate, and as a result, our data center revenue growth forecast for next year is now higher than prior expectations,” said Matt Murphy, Marvell’s Chairman and CEO. “I am also excited to announce the acquisition of Celestial AI – a transformational milestone that accelerates our scale-up roadmap for interconnect.

Pioneer Power’s revenue performance exceeded our initial expectations this quarter. While Pioneer Power’s current margin profile differs from Limbach’s, we are actively integrating Pioneer into the Limbach platform and have a path to implement operational and commercial enhancements that we expect will expand its margins over time.

In addition, ODR gross profit grew 24.6%, representing 79.3% of total gross profit.

This momentum continues to build, reinforcing our confidence in our growth strategy and Limbach’s position as a leading provider of essential building systems solutions for existing critical infrastructure.\n\n“We believe we are still in the early stages of fully realizing the value of our customer relationships and market reach. To build on this momentum, we’ve made strategic investments in our sales organization aimed at strengthening our go-to-market strategy — prioritizing enhancements to our national account approach and accelerating our ability to collaborate with customers on their capital programs. These efforts are aimed at deepening relationships, enhancing engagement, and positioning us as a trusted, long-term partner. This, combined with a robust M&amp;A pipeline and disciplined operational execution, positions Limbach well for continued growth and we remain focused on creating long-term value for our stockholders.”",

We have successfully recruited legally eligible replacement associates and anticipate that Q3 will be the low point of labor inefficiencies, with gradual improvement beginning in the fourth quarter.”\n\n“We completed two acquisitions during our second quarter: Universal Plastics &amp; Engineering (UNIPEC) and Techno Plastics Industries (TPI),” said Bailly. These will expand our capabilities in tight-tolerance specialty film components and in thermoplastic molding for the medical device market. In addition, we continued to make progress with our expansion plans in Santiago and La Romana, Dominican Republic, to accommodate further anticipated growth in the safe patient handling and robotic-assisted surgery markets.”",

In fact, the fourth quarter was the highest revenue quarter for the company in the past twenty-five years! Margins and operating income were historically high also, resulting in excellent results for the fiscal year. We have demonstrated strong growth over the past several years, and I believe the growth potential for our company is expanding even further. That being said, it must be recognized that the recently ended quarter benefitted from strong execution that allowed the company to produce revenue and profit on several programs in FY25 that were originally scheduled to start in FY25 and continue in FY26 and beyond. I am very proud of this performance by a clearly dedicated and committed FEI workforce; however, while the trend is very much an upward one, it is unreasonable to expect every quarter in the near-term to replicate this performance, though in the medium and longer term I am confident it is where we are headed.\n\n“The recently passed US budget legislation clearly shows the strong administration commitment to space and defense we have been anticipating, however it is also clear that this administration is re-thinking the overall space architecture and the procurement process to achieve it. We have already seen this in the form of several re-directed proposal efforts. FEI has anticipated this, and is well prepared for it. While the impact on our business in the short term is somewhat unpredictable, we believe the medium to longer term trends are even more positive than we previously believed.",

Owned by Greek PPC Renewables (PPCR), a wholly owned subsidiary of utility PPC Group, the project was constructed by engineering procurement and construction (EPC) company Terna SA by repurposing the land of a former coal mine with high-performance solar energy infrastructure to generate clean, lower-cost electricity. Now in its final stage of construction, Oricheio PPC Ptolemaida is the largest single solar power project in Greece and is estimated to provide nearly 1.8% of the country’s electricity per year when fully operational.\n\n&gt;Large-scale solar projects play a key role in advancing Europe’s drive to energy independence and net-zero carbon goals by 2050. This project represents a significant milestone, adding clean power generation capacity to the grid and bringing new economic development benefits to the region. According to Greece’s revised National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), the country aims to reach a target of 82% renewable energy in its electricity generation by 2030, a significant increase from the previous target of 66% set in 2019.\n\n&gt;The 550 MW Oricheio PPC Ptolemaida solar project is an important step to increase energy independence in Europe and derisk capacity shortages for the region,” said Howard Wenger, president, Nextracker. “We are honored to partner with leaders like Terna SA and Greece’s utility PPC who are operating at the highest European standards for executing large-scale utility solar projects. This landmark project reinforces our culture of serving our customers with world class technology, backed by our talented European team and a robust supply chain ecosystem.”",

Claims to follow some sort of ethical capitalism framework.\n\nHow the hell are they commanding such high margins (37% gross, 8% net) while paying good wages and such?\n\nPasture-raised food is not really a special product in Europe and certainly is more expensive, but not to that degree.\n\nCan any US American that knows these products explain to me why you would buy them? Is pasture-raised food a niche market of some sorts? Is it coastal well-off people that buy these over mass farmed products just because they can? The avocado toast folk? Is it some kind of healthy food movement? Is the taste much better? Does the brand evoke good feelings (e.g. me buying apples and potatoes from the nice farmer nearby)?\n\nI know that some US food for the masses is really of mediocre quality (precut toast bread, processed cheese, produce...) but these products were never really replaced with \"better\" versions so I assume this is what the market demands/supports. How come pasture-raised food (or at least this company) is (suddenly) so successful?",

During the first quarter, we also received full notice to proceed for the Sandow Lakes Power Station, a 1.2 GW ultra-efficient combined-cycle natural gas-fired plant in Lee County, Texas, which increased our backlog to a record $1.9 billion as of April 30, 2025.  \n  \nIn addition to our record backlog, our project pipeline is robust, reflecting the energy industry's urgent response to the growing strain on our power grids related to the building of data centers, the onshoring of complex manufacturing, and an increasing amount of EV charging activity.

For the first time in decades, energy demand is rising, coinciding with the end of the operational lives for a significant portion of the aging natural gas energy facilities capable of providing reliable, 24/7 power.  \n  \nAfter several years of underinvestment, there is an immediate need for the development of new energy resources, and Argan's energy-agnostic capabilities and proven track record of success position us well as we compete for the construction of large and complex power generating facilities.

We believe Elbit is well positioned to capture and benefit from the opportunities of increasing defense budgets globally and particularly in Europe with our well-established subsidiaries across the continent as evident in our published contract wins.

(RACE) delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2025, showcasing a robust performance across key metrics. The company reported net revenues of €1.791 billion, marking a 13% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Ferrari shipped 3,593 units, reflecting a slight growth of 1% year-over-year.\n\nOperating profit (EBIT) surged by 22.7% to €542 million, resulting in a margin of 30.3%. Net profits climbed to €412 million, showing a 17% rise from the previous year, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) reaching €2.30, an improvement from €1.95 in Q1 2024.\n\nThe revenue growth was driven by a diverse and enriched product range, including the Ferrari Roma Spider, 296 GTS, SF90 XX family, and Purosangue. Notably, hybrid models comprised 49% of total shipments, emphasizing Ferrari's commitment to electrification. The company also unveiled two new special versions, the 296 Speciale and 296 Speciale A.\n\nLooking forward, Ferrari maintains a strong outlook for 2025, projecting revenues exceeding €7.0 billion, a 5% increase from 2024. They anticipate an adjusted EBIT of approximately €2.03 billion and industrial free cash flow around €1.20 billion, representing a growth of 7% and 17%, respectively.\n\nFurther, to manage new US import tariffs, Ferrari announced potential price increases of up to 10% for certain models, which may affect profitability margins by 50 basis points. Despite these challenges, Ferrari's strategic focus on product mix and its capacity to uphold premium pricing underscores its resilient business model.\"\n\nI did some large ex-US repositioning during the liberation day period, selling out of V, MA, and MANH. RACE was one of the two positions I went into as the valuation felt reasonable enough relative to the company's quality management team, pricing power, and brand strength. I'm not surprised to see them managing the current uncertainty well. \n\nI'm really happy about the focus on product mix, as shipments only went up 0.9% despite double digit revenue and EPS growth. The key to being a luxury business is ensuring your brand is not diluted through endless supply or incessant low quality releases. The only disappointment I have is their current F1 season :/",

With a strong balance sheet and a compelling multi-year cash generation profile, Hexcel is well-positioned to navigate the current environment and for the future. However, as a result of continued supply chain driven delays in commercial aircraft production rate ramps, particularly on the Airbus A350 program, our 2025 growth will not be what we initially forecasted. As a result, we are revising our 2025 guidance.”\n\n&gt;“We will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business this year, carefully managing costs given the current realities in the commercial aerospace market. This includes tightly managing our headcount as we right size for the demand we have and not outpacing the future rate increases by our OEM customers. We are generally not replacing headcount lost to attrition and our current headcount is roughly 100 individuals lower than December 31 and about five percent lower than our 2025 planning had previously targeted for the end of March. Despite these near-term challenges in the commercial aerospace market, we are seeing growth in our Defense and Space business, and we remain focused on enhancing the value Hexcel brings to our customers and strengthening the overall business through innovation and continual improvement. Reflecting our underlying confidence, we repurchased $50 million of stock in first quarter as we also successfully refinanced $300 million of fixed rate debt,” continued Gentile.",
